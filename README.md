================
****FUZZ TESTS BY dimakuz ARE NOW UP****

Instructions:

1. Download the files from this repository.
2. Compile your code with the main.cpp file I uploaded here. it's modified so the test modules would get its output correctly.
3. define an enivronment variable called "WET2_EXEC" to hold the full path of your executable file (in bash shell - get the path to the running directory by typing 'pwd', and define the env. var. by typing " export WET2_EXEC='[path of exec]' " (with "[path of exec]" being the running directory you got from pwd + your executable name)
4. run "SimpleTest.py" as you would run any other script in unix shell.


NOTE: "Simulator.py" should be in the same folder with "SimpleTest.py"

NOTE2: "SimpleTest.py" tests are really short and easy to follow. If you experience any "diff" errors, please check manually first and make sure what output you need to expect from the commands.
